Skeleton to help kickstart small angular applications

### Getting Started

1) Clone/Download this repo
2) Run `npm install` inside the repo directory to install the dependencies, and build the vendor files.
3) Run `npm start` to build the src files and start the server.

### ToDo:
* Implement backend, haven't decided what framework if any.
* Profile view, display information/posts by a specified user
* Users view, display a list of users, with links to each of their profiles
* Home view, probably display a list of friend's posts or something
